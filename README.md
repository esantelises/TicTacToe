## Summary

This improved version of Tic-Tac-Toe lets you keep track of each player's wins and ties, making the game more competitive and fun. Here are some special features:

### Track Wins and Ties
- The game keeps a count of how many times each player wins and how many games end in a tie. This helps you see who is doing better over time.

### Review and Reverse Moves
- You can look back at all the moves made during the game and go back to any previous point. This helps you think about your moves and see what could have been done differently.

### Updates as You Play
- The game tells you whose turn it is next, and when someone wins or if itâ€™s a tie, it announces the result right away.

### Quick Start or Reset
- With just a click, you can start a new game or reset the scores to play again.
